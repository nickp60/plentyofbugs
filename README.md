##  WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains the pipeline to identity a suitable reference isolate based on comparing a mini assembly to a set of complete genomes via [pyani](github.com/widdowquinn/pyani).  While this is used for riboSeed, its purpose was deemed different enough to warrant its own repository.  For more information, see [this page on choosing reference genomes](https://riboseed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/REFERENCE.html).
